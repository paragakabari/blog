                  seasoned entrepreneur, unlock the full potential of AI to
                  drive growth, efficiency, and success in your business

                  These 7 online tools, including one that builds an entire
                  website in under 30 seconds, aim to save you time and money.
                  We tested them out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, you want to start your own business. What now?
                  <br /><br />
                  It can be challenging to strike out on one’s own. You might
                  have a brilliant business idea, but a shortage of resources to
                  bring the idea to life. Aside from actually developing your
                  product or service, there’s consulting, design, copywriting,
                  photography and videography – which means two things: time and
                  money.
                  <br /><br />
                  Or does it? With artificial intelligence constantly evolving
                  at a rapid rate, there are now plenty of online tools that
                  could assist with everything from logo design to website
                  building – in turn, alleviating some of the stress that comes
                  with starting a business.
                  <br /><br />
                  To see how AI might help me start a business, I decided to
                  test out an idea. In this scenario, I’m moving to upstate New
                  York to start a new life as a beekeeper and launch a honey
                  business. Using this idea, I tested out popular AI tools with
                  seven areas of focus. These are certainly not the only tools
                  that exist, but I chose these particular ones based on
                  recommendations, cost and ease of use.
                  <br /><br />
                  This list is organized using common problems a newbie business
                  owner might face in the process of starting up. Keep reading
                  to see AI’s answer to these problems.

                <h5>
                  1. I have an idea for a business and I need honest feedback.
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Let’s face it – friends and family are not always the best
                  people to ask for feedback. They’ll likely tell you your idea
                  is brilliant, but will fail to point out any flaws. I pumped
                  my idea into ValidatorAI, a free, AI-generated business
                  consultant designed to give you the real talk. It is designed
                  to point out any flaws in your brilliant idea that you need to
                  work on, as well as offer advice on how to make your idea
                  work.
                  <br /><br />
                  Cost: The feedback is free. However, if you want access to
                  mentors, helpful videos, an e-book and a private Discord where
                  you can talk to other members, you can get a subscription for
                  $5 per month. <br /><br />
                  Test: Turns out my honey company idea had a few potential
                  stumbling blocks. ValidatorAI told me to check with my local
                  authorities about any regulations governing beekeeping
                  businesses. And it also displayed some impressive industry
                  knowledge. It asked me what beekeeping setup I planned on
                  using – which is a great question, because if I’m going to
                  become a beekeeper, I should probably learn the difference
                  between Langstroth, Top Bar and Warré. <br /><br />
                </p>
                <h5>2. I need a business name and a domain.</h5>
                <p>
                  Choosing a name for your business can be a real hangup. Once
                  you choose a name, it will be printed on business cards and
                  packaging and maybe even displayed on a storefront.
                  NamingMagic makes it easy not just to choose a name, but to
                  see if the domain you want is available. This tool was built
                  by two former entrepreneurs who have spent hours brainstorming
                  company names and wanted to find an easier way with GPT-3
                  natural language technology. Even if you don’t choose one of
                  the names the generator comes up with, it can be a useful tool
                  to draw inspiration from if you’re experiencing a creative
                  block.

                  Cost: Free <br /><br />
                  Test: If I input my product description (locally sourced
                  honey) and some key words (beekeeper, honey, farm, bees,
                  local) into NamingMagic, it generates three names: Beehive
                  Farms, Local Buzz Honey and Honeycomb Harvest. I can see by
                  the domains shaded in green which ones are available to use.
                  If I don’t like any of the names, I can just press “Name My
                  Startup” again for more options. <br /><br />

                <h5>. I also need a logo.</h5>
                <p>
                  3 Unless you have artistic skills, it’s likely you’re thinking
                  of hiring a graphic designer to design your company’s logo.
                  But with LogoAi, you don’t have to. This tool generates a
                  selection of logos based on your chosen business name, slogan,
                  industry, color scheme and font styles – all in under one
                  minute. While scrolling through the options, you are free to
                  customize them until you’re happy with your final logo design.
                  <br /><br />
                  Cost: The basic package is $29, the pro package is $59 and the
                  brand package is $99. You can make and download a logo with
                  the basic package.<br /><br />
                  Test: This logo for Beehive Farms was created by just
                  inputting the company name, selecting a warm color palette
                  (for joy, enthusiasm and happiness, according to the
                  description) and a “Slab” font (logos of companies like Sony
                  and Volvo were shown as examples of this font). There were
                  pages of options to choose from, and I had the option to make
                  my own tweaks. The logo next to the company name was
                  originally a square shape, but I was able to easily change it
                  to a hexagon to get more of a honeycomb shape.<br /><br />

                <h5>4. What about a website?</h5>
                <p>
                  What was once a time-consuming task can now be done in under
                  30 seconds. No, really. With Durable, all you have to do is
                  enter three pieces of information: your location, the type of
                  business you are starting and the name of your business. It
                  will generate all the framework of a website, specific to your
                  company. After creating an account, you can customize it
                  further with your own logo and photos.
                  <br /><br />
                  Cost: The packages range from $12 per month to $25 per month.
                  You can choose between being billed monthly or annually.
                  <br /><br />
                  Test: After I entered the terms “New York,” “Honey,” and
                  “Beehive Farms,” Durable generated a website for me in under
                  30 seconds. All of the text was generated by AI, but I
                  obviously had to add and delete some sentences to make sure
                  the website was accurately describing my company. It came with
                  stock images, so I sifted through Durable’s media library to
                  choose photos. I was also able to add my own logo to the
                  header.
                </p>
                <h5>5. I need to hire a copywriter.</h5>
                <p>
                  Not necessarily. While you will need copy for all of your
                  marketing and sales material – think product descriptions,
                  emails, web copy, advertisements, social media posts and
                  newsletters – there is a cheaper way with Craftly.AI.
                  According to its website, the tool is used for copywriting by
                  creatives at companies such as Forbes, Meta and GoDaddy. Plus,
                  with a greeting at the top of the page reading, “Hello human,
                  what are we writing?” it’s easy to pretend you have a little
                  robot as an assistant – which you kind of do.
                  <br /><br />
                  Cost: The starter package is $29 per month, the crafter
                  package is $66 per month and the enterprise package price
                  varies depending on the size of the enterprise. <br /><br />
                  Test: I asked Craftly.AI to write a press release about
                  Beehive Farms having a tent at the 2023 Ithaca Apple Festival.
                  After briefly describing what I wanted to say and stating who
                  the audience is, the tool generated three different press
                  releases for me. I just had to change the last sentence on
                  this one, because it initially said that Beehive Farms has
                  been participating in the festival since 2003, which would be
                  incorrect because this is a new business. However, the tool
                  found all the information about the date and location of the
                  festival on its own, plus it added lots of nice details.
                  Here’s the release:
