<h6> Set Specific, Achievable Goals </h6>
<p>   
Research indicates that clear and attainable goals greatly enhance the chances of success. A study published in PubMed found that people who set specific goals were more likely to achieve them than those with vague intentions. Instead of a general goal like “lose weight” or “get fit,” aim for precise, measurable objectives, such as “exercise for 30 minutes five days a week” or “eat five servings of vegetables daily.” </p>

According to NIH research, self-compassion involves caring for your own well-being and is linked to increased personal initiative for making positive changes. Self-compassionate individuals are less likely to berate themselves for failures and more capable of admitting mistakes, adjusting unproductive behaviors, and tackling new challenges. Instead of harsh self-criticism, offer yourself kindness and understanding when setbacks occur, and refocus on your goals with a positive attitude.


</p>

<h6> Implement Behavior Change Techniques
</h6>


<p> Behavior change techniques like self-monitoring, goal-setting, and social support are effective for sticking to health goals. A meta-analysis in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that interventions using multiple behavior change techniques were more successful in promoting healthy behaviors than those using just one technique. To enhance your progress, consider using a habit-tracking app, seeking support from friends or family, or joining a community or online group for accountability and motivation. Additionally, working with a Health Coach at STAT Wellness can help you stay engaged with your goals, foster positive behavior changes, and address any obstacles that arise.



</p>

<h6> Focus on Small Wins
</h6>

<p>Celebrating small victories can significantly boost your confidence and momentum as you work towards larger health goals. Research from the University of California, Los Angeles, shows that recognizing even minor progress can improve motivation and perseverance. Whether it’s achieving a new personal best at the gym, resisting a tempting treat, or consistently hitting your daily step count, make sure to acknowledge and celebrate these accomplishments to stay motivated and inspired.



 </p>

<h6> Cultivate Resilience </h6>

<p>   
Resilience, or the ability to recover from setbacks and adversity, is essential for achieving long-term health goals. Research indicates that those with greater resilience are more likely to sustain healthy behaviors despite challenges. To build your resilience, work on developing effective coping strategies, creating a strong support network, and maintaining a positive outlook. Remember, setbacks are a natural part of any journey, and resilience involves how you respond and adapt to these challenges. </p>
